I plan to post semi-regular content on the development of the model as well as other AFL phenomenon which interest me."

I’m interested in statistics and financial and betting markets, and most importantly AFL. The long-term goal of HGR is to combine these interests to create a margin model with an edge on betting markets. Outside of my stuides I work as a management consultant and enjoy swimming and running.\nIf you’re interested in talking, send me a message at holygrailratings@gmail.com or on X at @HG_Ratings."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nI’ve taken this scoring shots terminology from Matter of Stats.↩︎\nThis is the explainer for the Xscore calculations I use.↩︎\nMAE measures the absolute prediction difference. If the expected margin is 12 and the final score is 24 or 0 the MAE is 12 in each case. This measure is chosen because ODELO is optimised for margin prediction.↩︎\nThis article explains the observed correlation between win probability and expected margin and totals.↩︎"
