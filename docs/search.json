I use an offensive and defensive ELO (ODELO) system (Read more here) that quantifies the performance of a team’s abilities on each side of the ball relative to the average team at a neutral venue. I plan to post semi-regular content on the development of the model as well as other AFL phenomenon wich interest me."

There’s a lot of work left to do on this project which I’ll discuss at the end of the post. But for now I think its best to explain how the model currently works, why I’ve made particular choices, and how to interpret the dashboards on the homepage."
